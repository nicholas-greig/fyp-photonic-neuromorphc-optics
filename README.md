# FYP-Photonics-Neuromorphic-Optics
A repo to house the work I did as part of my FYP at Monash University!

This project involved a literature review on Photonics for Neuromorphic AI hardware,
and a somewhat novel proposed extension to the 'Photonic Modulator Neuron', that involved systems level considerations of the cascadability and weight-updates of an entire network comprised of these neurons.
